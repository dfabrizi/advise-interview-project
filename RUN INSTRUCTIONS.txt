Launch Instructions:

Installing
==========
1. Install python 2.7.9 : https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install pip (python package installer): https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py 
then open the pip file
3. Move the file "get-pip.py" to the "app" folder within the "advise-interview-project" folder
4. In command line (i.e. windows powershell), navigate to directory 
where "advise-interview-project" folder is stored, then navigate to the app folder within.
5. Run python in command line (i.e. windows powershell): using the command "python"
6. If the "python" command isn't working, then in the command line (i.e. powershell), enter
this: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")

Then try the "python" command again.

This should start to run python, and give you something like this:

Python 2.7.9 (default, Jun 30 1014, 16:03:49) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

7. Run get-pip.py: using command "python get-pip.py"
8. Exit python: using  the command ctrl+"c"
9. Install flask: using the command "python -m pip install Flask"
10. Install Virtual Environment: using the command "python -m pip install virtualenv"
11. Run virtual environment by changing directory, specifying entire path through:
/advise-interview-project/interview_site/scripts/activate

If this doesn't work, proceed for the sake of demonstrating the project.

12. Change directory to /advise-interview-project/app
13. Run python (type "python" in command line) and run newServer.py: 
using the command "python newServer.py"
14. Now, the server should be up and running on port 5000
15. Go to browser (preferably google chrome) and type "localhost:5000"

Site Usage
==========
1. From their you can enter the site, you'll be directed to the login page
2. Click "create account" and you'll be directed to the create account page
3. Fill out the create account form correctly and your user account will be 
added to the database.
NOTE: must be a company email (i.e. must have a '@advisetechnologies.com' or '@adviserms.com' domain)
NOTE: you cannot create an account where "email" and "confirm email" don't match or "password"
and "confirm password" do not match
4. After you have created your account, you will be redirected to the login page,
where you can enter your username and password.
5. Once logged in, you will be directed to the "interviews" page." Here you will see
a section called "Old Interviews," which contains a listing of test interviews I've
entered to make sure the site was functioning properly.
6. At the bottom, you will see a "New Interviews" Section, where there are two interview
formats for positions I saw listed on advisetechnologies.com. As an intern I can work
on creating interview templates for other open positions. The questions I created were
based on the position requirements and responsibilities listed on the Advise website.
7. You can select either of those interview formats - either "New Interview - Junior SQL Developer"
or "New Interview - Mid-Level C#/SQL Developer". There you can fill out interviews, which
will be submitted to the database for tracking once you click "submit".
8. In addition, upon submitting a new interview, you will be redirected to the original
"Interviews" page, where you will find a new link has been added to the list of interviewee
names.
9. When you click on the name of the candidate you entered, you will be directed to
a page that grabs the interview data from the database and puts it into the interview
form. This is how you will see previous interviews, thus tracking interview data.
