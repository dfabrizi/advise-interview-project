Site Usage
==========
1. From their you can enter the site, you'll be directed to the login page
2. Click "create account" and you'll be directed to the create account page
3. Fill out the create account form correctly and you're user account will be 
added to the database.
NOTE: must be a company email (i.e. must have a '@advisetechnologies.com' or '@adviserms.com' domain)
NOTE: you cannot create an account where "email" and "confirm email" don't match or "password"
and "confirm password" do not match
4. After you have created your account, you will be redirected to the login page,
where you can enter your username and password.
5. Once logged in, you will be directed to the "interviews" page." Here you will see
a section called "Old Interviews," which contains a listing of test interviews I've
entered to make sure the site was functioning properly.
6. At the bottom, you will see a "New Interviews" Section, where there are two interview
formats for positions I saw listed on advisetechnologies.com. As an intern I can work
on creating interview templates for other open positions. The questions I created were
based on the position requirements and responsibilities listed on the Advise website.
7. You can select either of those interview formats - either "New Interview - Junior SQL Developer"
or "New Interview - Mid-Level C#/SQL Developer". There you can fill out interviews, which
will be submitted to the database for tracking once you click "submit".
8. In addition, upon submitting a new interview, you will be redirected to the original
"Interviews" page, where you will find a new link has been added to the list of interviewee
names.
9. When you click on the name of the candidate you entered, you will be directed to
a page that grabs the interview data from the database and puts it into the interview
form. This is how you will see previous interviews, thus tracking interview data.
